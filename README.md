# Java Output Formatting

## What to do 
- The java System.out.printf function can be used to print formatted output.
- Every line of input will contain a String followed by an integer.
- Each String will have a maximun of 10 alphabetic characters.
- Each Integer will be inclusive range from 0 to 999.
- In each line of output there should be two columns:
    - The first column contains the String and is left justified using exactly 15 characters.
    - The second column contains the integer, expressed in 3 exactly  digits; if the original input has less than three digits, you must 
      pad your output's leading digits with zeroes.
- Sample intput:
    - java 100
    - cpp 65
    - python 50
- Sample output
    - ================================

    - cpp 065
    python 050
